power-bi-desktop-projects Manufacturing-BI-Solution

End-to-end Business Intelligence solution simulating ERP data for global manufacturing operations using Python, SQL, and Power BI. This project simulates an end-to-end Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a global manufacturing enterprise. It mirrors how real organizations use ERP systems (such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 or SAP) to track plant-level performance, production orders, machine downtime, inventory movement, quality control, and cost tracking across regions.

🚧 Project Status: In Progress — dataset generation complete; data modeling and dashboards in development.

📦 Project Overview

This solution aims to replicate a realistic manufacturing BI scenario by:

Creating large, relational datasets representing production, inventory, cost, machine events, and quality logs

Modeling ERP-style schema in SQL

Building intuitive Power BI dashboards for executive, plant-level, and operational users

🧪 Data Generation

Synthetic data was generated using Python (faker, pandas, numpy). Tables include:

Dimension tables: Plants, Products, Operators, Machines, Fault Types, Shifts, Calendar Dates

Fact tables: Production Orders, Quality Logs, Machine Downtime Events, Cost Journals, Inventory Movements

The data generator script is located in the /notebooks directory under 01_data_generation.ipynb.

💾 Output files are saved in the /datasets/ folder.

🗃️ Data Model Schema

A star-schema model with 7 dimensions and 5 fact tables.

SQL schema file (under /sql/schema.sql) is optimized for Azure SQL or PostgreSQL

Foreign key constraints and indexing for performance and joins

📌 Schema highlights best practices in ERP BI data warehousing.

📊 Business Intelligence Dashboards

The final dashboard will include:

Production Efficiency Overview

Cost vs. Standard Cost Analysis

Machine Downtime & Fault Diagnosis

Quality Defect Heatmaps & Trends

Inventory Movement by Plant & Product

Files will be available in the /powerbi folder as .pbix or .pbit templates.
